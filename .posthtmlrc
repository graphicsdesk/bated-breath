The five presidential campaigns were all Democratic candidates: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Notably, donations to Sanders, the only candidate to run in both races, remained at around $70,000 from 2016 to 2020, indicating a solid base of support among Columbia donors for the progressive wing of the Democratic party."

Much of this growth can be attributed to the fact that Columbia affiliates gave much more to Trump’s competitors in 2016, whereas this year, Trump was the assumed Republican candidate by virtue of his role as the incumbent. In the 2016 elections, Trump barely outraised even George Pataki, who dropped out of the race in December 2015. In fact, the first Trump donation from a Columbia affiliate that cycle was recorded in March 2016, once he began to secure his position as the presumptive Republican nominee following his first Super Tuesday primary victory."

Donations from undergraduate students dropped 8 percent between elections, perhaps due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the youngest and least financially-secure demographic of the Columbia population. Additionally, Columbia undergraduate students who donate may not choose to self-report themselves as “employees” of the University, so FEC data may not show the full extent of campaign contributions from the undergraduate student body."

The number of donors was processed to be unique, but the number of donations is not, as a single donor may have made multiple donations to any number of campaigns.\n\nOccupational data was manually sorted into the categories shown. “Faculty” includes adjunct, assistant, and tenure-track professors and deans. “Teaching positions” include lecturers, educators, teachers, instructors, and coaches. “Admin” refers to administrative managers, assistants, directors, and executives in business, communications, media, finance, IT, operations, development, HR, and marketing roles. “Academia and research” refers to historians, chemists, librarians, and postdoctoral researchers. “Medical & health” includes physicians, public health experts, and medical researchers. “Undergraduates” also refers to unspecified interns and work-study recipients. “Graduate students” include doctoral and masters students as well as unspecified teaching assistants.\n\nSee our data analysis and documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/graphicsdesk/2020-campaign-contributions\"><b>here</b></a>.\n\n\nRaeedah Wahid is the Graphics Editor at Spectator.
