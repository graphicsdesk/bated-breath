In fact, the first Trump donation from a Columbia affiliate that cycle was recorded in March 2016, once he began to secure his position as the presumptive Republican nominee following his first Super Tuesday primary victory."

Donations from undergraduate students dropped 25% between elections, perhaps due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the youngest and least financially-secure demographic of the Columbia population. Additionally, Columbia undergraduate students who donate may not self-report themselves as “employees” of the University, so FEC data may not show the full extent of campaign contributions from the undergraduate student body."
